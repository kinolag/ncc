	These three ideas keep recurring in my experience of life. In media and communication, in composition, and in programming. In one's mind, in machines and in society.
	<br><br>
	I studied communication and multimedia at the faculty of literature and philosophy in Torino,  where I graduated in 2003. When I explored the topic of the integration of various media in websites, I said I would do it through the lens of some "high density nodes" like technology, media, or languages, and with "attacks from different sides". 
	<br><br>
	Maybe the latter idea came to me from basketball, a game I have played from the age of 6. I am now working as a coach at a club in London, an inclusive project where we can all learn from each other.
	<br><br>
	I am also into music, film and photography, and I studied studio composition while working as video editor and studio manager in my home town Milano and in London, where I have been living for over ten years.

	The Italian word <i class="monospace">nodo</i> means both node and knot.
	<br><br>
	I like thinking of it as all of these (dictionary definitions): "a point at which lines or pathways intersect or branch; a central or connecting point", "a fastening made by tying a piece of string, rope, or something similar" and "a knob, protuberance, or node in a stem, branch, or root."
	<br><br>
	Those in the table below can be seen as some useful concepts for project ideas, or building blocks.
	</p>

	<p class="w40 bg_azzurro">
	As opposed to having one role for most of our life, or a fixed job title which we are identified for, our experience becomes more and more fluid, our knowledge the result of <i class="monospace"></i>cycles</i> between different or opposite states. 
	<br><br>
	If we want to write code, we first have to study other people's code. If we make music with samples we first have to listen and process sounds either we or other people recorded. Someone approaches a problem, writes a function that did not exist, or introduces a new tag in a new version of a language, and from that moment other people will be able to use one line of code instead of writing a few. 
	<br><br>
	In all these cases we are not "100% author", but keep reprocessing material that is recombined over time.
	<br><br>
	Think about the idea behind Creative Commons. One of the licenses states: "you are free to adapt, remix, transform, and build upon the material (...)

	We are now potentially always connected to the net, to the people we know, and also those we don't know... yet.
	<br><br>
	<i class="monospace">Connections</i> happen and develop all the time between different people, areas, topics, phenomena. Talking or chatting to someone by phone or travelling between two cities are simple examples, but working with sound and image is another one, and variables can establish connections too. These happen between nodes, or through nodes. 
	<br><br>
	A mind can be a node, and the strings *itter or *ode can trigger connections in my mind that don't exist elsewhere, until I share them by talking to someone, writing a document or publishing a web page.	
	</p>
	<p class="w33 bg_arancio">
	My idea of <i class="monospace">ciclomedia</i> refers to our experience of the information world, continuously moving between different sources, devices, and languages (verbal, non-verbal and programming ones), while being modified in the process. This was clearly possible before the internet was created, but expanded since we could access the net, and "exploded", or accelerated reaching new speeds and forms, when we started to use "smart" phones and other portable devices which are (almost) always with us.

	I have been interested in the web for a long time, building static websites on my own but after working as web producer at a younger age, I have only done it in my spare time as I worked in post-production and studio workflows for the last 15 years. The websites linked above contain mostly basic CSS and old style table-based layouts (however some of them adaptive), but the bits of JavaScript I integrated into some of the pages were written by other people and used to solve specific problems.
	<br><br>
	I have also been interested in programming, but after studying some C a long time ago, I have not worked with text-based coding, other than HTML and CSS. I used more a visual programming environment like Max/Jitter, which helped me understand loops, cycles, and certain algorithm structures applied to MIDI, sound and image. 
	<br><br>
	Only recently I finally decided to learn JavaScript and after some time studying it I hope this powerful language will help me develop old and new projects, find even more connections while meeting new people and opportunities in the process. A few weeks ago I also completed an introductory course about Ruby.
	<br><br>
	One of the latest additions to Max is the <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max-features#node-for-max" class="A1n" title="Node 4 Max">ability to run NodeJS applications</a>, and last year I found out about the <a href="https://p5js.org/" class="A1n" title="p5.js">p5.js library</a>: two more reasons for me to use JavaScript, which seems to have become more and more ubiquitous.
	<br><br>
	I would love to be a student at FAC as the co-operative environment and organisational model make the programme really stimulating, different from what other alternatives can offer and closer to what I am looking for.
